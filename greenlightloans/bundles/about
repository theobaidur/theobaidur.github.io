They were amazing in assisting me in refinancing our home. They were easy to contact and kept us informed every step of the way. They went out of their way to be sure that any inspectors, signing agents, etc., met our schedule, and they were polite and professional. I would highly recommend Greenlight to anyone looking to refinance or finance a home!!!

I am a Realtor, so I have a knowledge of the lending industry. This was without exception a great experience from beginning to end. Additional thank you to Rick Dale who was the instrument to initiate this re-fi. His phone presence, professionalism and honesty was the key to letting me take the next step to Charmyne. AND, my husband and I now have a 15 year mortgage instead of a 30 year mortgage, for the SAME monthly payment.

The loan closed fast and they stayed on top of everything. Would not hesitate to call them again and do business.

Never mind the savings of close to $100,000 over the life of my loan, or the fact that my monthly payment was nearly the same while taking 10 years off the loan. Every single delay in the process was strictly on my end and completely facilitated by Greenlight the whole way. Gina Amicon, my Loan Consultant, and Kelly Hoffman and Saroeut Roun, my Closing Coordinators, were very knowledgeable, professional and responsive to all my questions and concerns from beginning to end of closing. They are invaluable assets to their organization and it would be my pleasure to do business with them again in the future."},{id:"14",clientThumb:"/Content/img/icons/icon-face-male.gif",clientName:"Dana W.",clientComment:"Just wanted to say what a pleasant experience we had refinancing our mortgage. Shawn Wyns and Peter Nguyen were the two best people to work with via phone and email. They were very quick to answer any questions I might have and always got back to me within hours and not days. We closed in just a couple of weeks from start to finish, without any issues. I would definitely recommend Greenlight Loans to any of my friends or family to refinance their mortgages. We took off 8 years and basically kept the same payment.
